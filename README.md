# GAME208-AR-Project

Create an AR version of a board game. Games like Clue, Chess and Monopoly can come to life using a mobile device. No more lost pieces and no more cheating in these digitized versions of real-world games. Assets can be found on many websites to integrate into the project, which do not have to adhere to the standard game pieces if they cannot be found.
